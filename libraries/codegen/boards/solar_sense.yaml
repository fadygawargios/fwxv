# Message Definitions in plaintext are on the wiki at:
# https://uwmidsun.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ELEC/pages/50003973/CAN+Message+Definitions
#
# If you are making changes to this file please update the corresponding entry
# on the wiki. If you need to add a new message use a reasonable
# reserved ID. The higher ID the lower the priority. Generally
# - 0-13: Critical messages (have ACK)
# - 14-30: Actionable messages (trigger a change in another system)
# - 30-63: Data messages (usually not actionable by an onboard device)
